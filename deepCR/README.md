### Installation

```bash
pip install deepCR
```

Or you can install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/profjsb/deepCR.git
cd deepCR/
pip install .
```

### Quick Start

Quick download of a HST ACS/WFC image

```bash
wget -O jdba2sooq_flc.fits https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0.1/Download/file?uri=mast:HST/product/jdba2sooq_flc.fits
```

With Python >=3.5:

For smaller sized images (smaller than ~1Mpix)
```python
from deepCR import deepCR
from astropy.io import fits
image = fits.getdata("jdba2sooq_flc.fits")[:512,:512]

# create an instance of deepCR with specified model configuration
mdl = deepCR(mask="ACS-WFC-F606W-2-32",
	     inpaint="ACS-WFC-F606W-2-32",
             device="CPU")

# apply to input image
mask, cleaned_image = mdl.clean(image, threshold = 0.5)
# best threshold is highest value that generate mask covering full extent of CR
# choose threshold by visualizing outputs.

# if you only need CR mask you may skip image inpainting and save time
mask = mdl.clean(image, threshold = 0.5, inpaint=False)

# if you want probabilistic cosmic ray mask instead of binary mask
prob_mask = mdl.clean(image, binary=False)
```

There's also the option to segment your input image into smaller pieces (default: 256-by-256)
and process the individual piece seperately before stitching them back together. This enables
multi-process parallelism and saves memory.

Segment-and-stitching is enabled by **n_jobs>1**, which specified the number of processes to utilize.
**n_jobs=-1** is the number of available virtual cores on your machine and is optimized for time
when your torch is not intel MKL optimized (see below for more details). 
```python
image = fits.getdata("jdba2sooq_flc.fits")
mask, cleaned_image = mdl.clean(image, threshold = 0.5, n_jobs=-1)

```
If your torch is intel MKL optimized, it's not necessary to open up many processes and one process
should utilize half of the CPUs available. Monitor CPU usage -- if CPU usage for single process 
is > 100% it means intel MKL is in place. In this case, ** n_jobs<=4** is advised. 

For single process segment-and-stitching, you need to manually enable **segment = True** because 
the default **n_jobs=1** assumes **segment = False**.
```python
image = fits.getdata("jdba2sooq_flc.fits")
mask, cleaned_image = mdl.clean(image, threshold = 0.5, segment = True)
```

Note that this won't speed things up if you're using GPU!
