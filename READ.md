# Cosmic-Ray-Deletion

This advanced solution uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and remove cosmic rays from astronomical images automatically. The CNN learns to recognize cosmic ray patterns by training on labeled data. It then scans new images, identifies potential cosmic ray locations, and removes artifacts using interpolation. This automation reduces manual effort, ensures accurate data treatment, and benefits various astronomical studies, observational surveys, and archival data preprocessing
