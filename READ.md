# Cosmic-Ray-Deletion

This is an advanced solution using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and remove cosmic rays from astronomical images. By training on labeled data, the CNN learns to recognize cosmic ray patterns. It then scans new images, identifies potential cosmic ray locations, and removes artifacts using interpolation. This automation reduces manual effort, ensures accurate data treatment, and benefits various astronomical studies, observational surveys, and archival data preprocessing
